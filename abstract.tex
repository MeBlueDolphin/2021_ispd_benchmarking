Circuit benchmarks for VLSI physical design
have been growing in size and complexity, helping
the industry tackle new problems and find new
approaches.  In this paper, we take a look back
at how benchmarking efforts have shaped the
research community, consider trade-offs that
have been made, and speculate on what may come
next.
