	ACM/SIGDA Benchmark Newsletter -- Special DACU92 Edition, June 1992
	-------------------------------------------------------------------

A large and expanding set of benchmarks is being maintained for free 
electronic distribution to all bone-fide members of the DA community. The 
costs of maintenance & computer services are being covered by a grant from 
the Association of Computing Machinery, Special Interest Group on Design 
Automation (ACM/SIGDA). You may copy and distribute the benchmarks further 
to your colleagues as long as you don't charge for these services.

Benchmarks are updated/corrected periodically and you may ftp to 
mcnc.mcnc.org and get the files in pub/benchmark/NEWS for an update. An 
example of such a procedure is listed below. If you have technical 
questions about the benchmarks, try to contact the benchmark originators 
whenever possible. If you want to share your results and comments, 
send email to benchmarks@mcnc.org and we will try to post them. For 
further information, send email to 
		
		Franc Brglez (brglez@mcnc.org) or call at 919-248-1925.

If you cannot use ftp, you may obtain benchmarks on tape. To obtain a copy 
of all current benchmarks on a tape, you must submit a check payable to 
ACM/SIGDA and drawn on a U.S. bank for $50 if you are an ACM/SIGDA member 
(member number required) or $150 if not an ACM/SIGDA member. Please, mail 
your request and check to

			Recent Announcements
			--------------------

9/29/92 - The NEW set of High Level Synthesis benchmarks for 1992 is
	available in the directory HLSynth92.  The new files are complete
	with documentation, simulation data, and a set of guidelines for
	reporting results and submitting new benchmarks.


03/25/92 - The benchmark set for the 1992 Intl. Wksp. on Layout Synthesis 
	is available in the directory LayoutSynth92.  Since this set repeats 
	most of the files found in the 1990 set, benchmark users may save 
	space by getting just the updated set.  See the readme files 
	LayoutSynth92 for details.

		How Can you Access the Benchmarks
		-----------------------------------------------------
		(Contributed by Clay Gloster, MCNC, gloster@mcnc.org)

The benchmark data can be obtained from MCNC by several methods:

The fastest method is to use the FTP protocol. If you are successful in 
retrieving the benchmarks via FTP, please e-mail your full address to 
benchmarks@mcnc.org, registering as a benchmark recipient. Benchmarks and 
related information are periodically updated and we can e-mail news about 
the  updates to registered recipients only.

If you cannot use ftp, you may obtain benchmarks on tape. To obtain a copy 
of all current benchmarks on a tape, you must submit a check payable to 
ACM/SIGDA and drawn on a U.S. bank for $50 if you are an ACM/SIGDA member 
(member number required) or $150 if not an ACM/SIGDA member. Please, mail 
your request and check to

		Clay Gloster, Benchmark Administrator
		MCNC, Center for Microelectronics
		P.O.Box 12889
		Research Triangle Park, N.C. 27709, U.S.A.

Contact the benchmark coordinator Clay Gloster by phone (919 248-1943) or 
email (benchmarks@mcnc.org) and tell him your requirements.  The types of 
tapes currently supported are:

	9-track reel tapes, 8mm cartridges, TK50 cartridges (DEC),
	1/4" cartridges.

If you are requesting a small number of filesets, it may be possible to 
have the files sent by e-mail.  This method is less reliable than using 
FTP, but is faster and free of charge.  If you feel that your e-mail 
connection is safe enough to try this method, send e-mail to 
benchmarks@mcnc.org.  Please, do not request large numbers of filesets to
be sent by this method.
 
Getting files by FTP
--------------------
You may establish an FTP connection to host "mcnc.mcnc.org" (128.109.130.1 
or 128.109.131.1) and copy the files using the "get" command. The login 
name is "anonymous" and the password is any string (we ask that you use 
your name or home login id). Look for .readme files in appropriate 
directories for more information.

The command sequence to establish a connection to the host machine is:

	ftp mcnc.mcnc.org
	anonymous 	(in response to the "Name" prompt)
	(your id) 	(in response to the "password" prompt)
	cd pub/benchmark/<YOUR CHOICE OF SUB-DIRECTORY>

The example below illustrates options that you may have when copying the 
HLSynth89 directory of benchmarks. Other directories are organized 
similarly.

If you can use the ``uncompress'' command on your UNIX machine, this is 
the fastest way to receive the benchmarks:

	cd pub/benchmark/HLSynth89
	binary
	get HLSynth89.tar.Z
	bye

On your local machine, you uncompress the file with the command

	uncompress HLSynth89.tar.Z

and un-tar the file with the command

	tar xvf HLSynth89.tar

If you do not have the uncompress utility, but do have ``tar'',
then take the uncompressed version, as in

	cd pub/benchmark/HLSynth89
	binary
	get HLSynth89.tar
	bye

and then on your local machine

	tar xvf HLSynth89.tar

If you do not have the ``tar'' utility available, you may have to copy the 
files explicitly.  In addition to one or more data directories, there may
be a documentation directory and/or a translator directory.  Also, don't
forget to get the top level *.readme files.  These files will usually have
any special instructions.  Use the ftp commands ``dir'' and ``cd'' to 
fully explore the benchmark directory before trying to explicitly get all 
of the files.  In the case of HLSynth89 you would:

	cd pub/benchmark/HLSynth89
	prompt
	get HLSynth89.readme
	get HLSynth89.list
        cd DATA              
        mget *
        cd ../DOCUMENTATION
        mget *
        bye

Getting the files in this manner will dump them all in the current 
directory on your local machine.  All of the files that used to be 
separated into the DATA and DOCUMENTATION directories will all end up 
together in the current directory.  For the less complex benchmark 
directories, this will not be too much of a problem.  However for some of 
the larger benchmark sets that contain a number of sub-directories, you 
may want to maintain the original directory structure on your local 
machine. Ftp makes this possible, though it is not easy.  Instead of 
simply using the "cd" and "mget" commands to move to a new directory and 
get the files, you will have to:

	1) Use the "! mkdir" command to create a matching new directory
	   on the local machine.
	2) Use the "lcd" command to move to the new directory on the
	   local machine.
	3) Use the "cd" command to move to the target directory on the
	   REMOTE machine.
	4) And finally, use "mget" to get the remote files.

The following example uses this process to make a copy of the HLSynth89
directory:

	! mkdir HLSynth89
	lcd HLSynth89
	cd pub/benchmark/HLSynth89
        prompt
	get HLSynth89.readme
	get HLSynth89.list
	! mkdir DATA
	lcd DATA
        cd DATA              
        mget *
	! mkdir ../DOCUMENTATION
	lcd ../DOCUMENTATION
        cd ../DOCUMENTATION
        mget *
        bye

Getting files by e-mail.
---------------------
To get files sent by e-mail, list the set[s] that you need in a message to
benchmarks@mcnc.org. This is not an automatic system, so no special format
is needed. You should receive the files soon after.

To reduce the number of bytes sent, the requested set of files will be:

	Archived into a single file with the 'tar' command;
	Compressed with the 'compress' command;
	Encoded into an ASCII representation with the 'uuencode' command;
	and Split into small, e-mailable pieces with the 'split' command.

The resulting files will be e-mailed to you.  The subject line of each
will indicate it's number and ordering.  An executable C-Shell script 
which can be used to recover the original benchmarks will also be sent, 
along with complete instructions for the process.

If you do not have access to the commands which will recover the original
files from the e-mail messages, namely 'tar', 'uncompress', 'uudecode',
and 'cat', let the benchmark coordinator know in your request.

		1992 Layout Benchmarks  and Participation Guidelines
		------------------------------------------------------
		(Contributed by Kris Kozminski, MCNC, kk@mcnc.org)

A special session on layout benchmarks has been held as a part of the 
International Workshop on Layout Synthesis, May 18-21, 1992. Researchers 
were invited to submit the results of the benchmark runs performed with 
their software for presentation at this session. There were two 
participants and the results generated a lot of discussion during the 
workshop. The participation is still open until the end of 1992. If you do 
participate, please consider the original guidelines below. Note however 
that a few paragraphs contain dated material and can be ignored.


Benchmark data
--------------
The benchmark set includes all the data distributed in connection with 
the International Workshop on Layout Synthesis held in May 1990, as well 
as several new circuits. The following is a complete listing of the 
benchmarks:

*  Building block (macro block) place & route: xerox (10 blocks, 203 
   nets), ami33 (33 blocks, 123 nets), apte (9 blocks, 97 nets), ami49 
   (49 blocks, 408 nets), hp (11 blocks, 83 nets).
   Added this year is xlii (62 blocks, 1611 nets).

*  Layout compaction: afakr (26 transistors),  afa (26 transistors),  
   c132_2 (hierarchical,  13 subcells containing 132 transistors), 
   mul2x2 (hierarchical, 4 subcells containing 54 transistors), mul4x4 
   (hierarchical, 13 subcells containing 222 transistors), mul8x8 
   (hierarchical, 28 subcells containing 518 transistors), mul16x16 
   (hierarchical, 58 subcells containing 1110 transistors).

*  Layout synthesis (from transistor-level netlist):  ti_alu (306 
   transistors), highway (332 transistors), accum (648 transistors), 
   fract (722 transistors), struct (8990 transistors), biomed (43486 
   transistors).

   Added this year are:  avq.small (139555 transistors), avq.large 
   (152595 transistors).

*  Mixed building block/standard cell place & route: g2 (113 cells, 17 
   blocks, 295 nets), a3 (519 cells, 27 blocks, 881 nets), t1 (434 
   cells, 26 blocks, 1059 nets).

*  Standard cell place & route: fract (125 cells, 147 nets), primary1 
   (752 cells, 904 nets), struct (1888 cells, 1920 nets), industry1 
   (2271 cells, 2594 nets), industry1a (2271 cells, 2479  nets), 
   primary2 (2907 cells, 3029 nets), biomed (6417 cells, 5766 nets), 
   industry2 (12142 cells, 13915 nets), industry3 (15059 cells, 21966 
   nets). Industry1 and industry1a require the over-the-cell routing 
   capability.

   Added this year are: balu (701 cells, 702 nets), sioo (602 cells, 259 
   nets), avq.small (21854 cells, 22124 nets), avq.large (25114 cells, 
   25384 nets). 

*  Gate array place & route: primary1,  primary2,  industry2,  industry3 
   (cell and net counts are given in the standard cell list).

*  Floorplanning: xerox (10 blocks, 203 nets), fan (10 blocks, 312 
   nets).

How to obtain the data
----------------------
The benchmark data can be obtained from MCNC in one of two ways: by ftp 
or on a 9-track tape. Send mail to benchmarks@mcnc.org for details of 
current policy to pay for the cost of shipping a tape.

1) Users who have access to the Internet:

You may establish an 'ftp' connection to the host 'mcnc.org' (also 
known as 'mcnc.mcnc.org'; IP node number 128.109.130.3) and copy the 
files using the 'mget' command. The login name is 'anonymous' and the 
password is any non-empty string of characters. The files are in the 
'pub/benchmark/LayoutSynth92' directory. Please consult the ftp 
manual for the details of operation. If you use ftp to obtain the 
benchmark data, please let me know about it so that I can contact you 
in case of any changes or corrections to the benchmarks or the 
software provided with them.

If you are a UNIX user, please check if you have the 'uncompress' 
command available. Transferring the benchmarks in a compressed form 
reduces the transfer time significantly. After establishing the ftp 
connection to mcnc.org, set the binary transfer mode and use the 
'get' command of ftp to import either the bench90.tar.Z, 
redun90.tar.Z, and bench92.tar.Z files (about 3.7 Mbytes) if you do 
have the uncompress command available, or bench90.tar, redun90.tar, 
and bench92.tar (about 13 Mbytes) otherwise.

NOTE: If you already have the benchmarks from 1990, all you need is 
the file bench92.tar (about 4 Mbytes) or its compressed version 
bench92.tar.Z (about 1 Mbyte).  Furthermore, retrieve floorplanning 
benchmark 'fan' (a buggy net name has been fixed in it). Before un-
tarring bench92.tar, remove or archive the contents of the 
directories: bench/v2 and bench/yal2vpnr.  The new release fixes a 
couple of bugs that surfaced when processing the new benchmarks.
Here are more details about retrieving the benchmarks. You might also 
want to consult the ftp manual for additional information.

The command sequence to establish a connection to the host machine is:

   ftp mcnc.mcnc.org
   anonymous   (in response to the 'Name' prompt)
   (your id)   (in response to the 'password' prompt)
   cd pub/benchmark/LayoutSynth92
   mget LayoutSynth92.*
   binary
   mget *.tar.Z
   bye

On your local machine, uncompress the file with the command

   uncompress bench90.tar.Z redun90.tar.Z bench92.tar.Z

Un-tar the files with the commands (recall the earlier explanation of 
why removing files below is necessary).

   tar xf bench90.tar
   tar xf redun90.tar
   /bin/rm -rf bench/v2 bench/yal2vpnr
   tar xf bench92.tar

Users who can use 'tar' but without the 'uncompress' command should 
get the non-compressed tar files:

   cd pub/benchmark/LayoutSynth92
   binary
   mget *.tar
   bye

then use the 'tar' command on your local machine as explained 
earlier:

If you are not a UNIX user and do not have the tar utility available, 
you will have to copy the benchmarks explicitly. The files with 
benchmark descriptions are stored in the 'bench' subdirectory of the 
pub/benchmark/LayoutSynth92 directory and in its subdirectories. As 
an added complication, the translators and some of the other programs 
in the bench directory will not work properly under a different 
directory structure.  Simply 'mget'-ing all the files into one 
directory on the local machine will destroy the original directory 
structure.  You should re-create the original structure and use ftp 
to copy the files into the correct places.  You can use the '! mkdir' 
command to make a new directory on your local machine from inside 
ftp. You should first replicate the entire tree of subdirectories 
rooted in the pub/benchmark/LayoutSynth92 directory. Use the 'get' 
command of ftp to the Index file from the pub/benchmark/LayoutSynth92 
directory. This file lists all subdirectories and files with the 
benchmark data and you can use it to create the necessary tree of 
directories. Then, use the 'cd' and 'lcd' commands of ftp to traverse 
synchronously the tree of directories on MCNC's ftp server machine 
and on your machine. In each directory, use the 'mget' command of ftp 
to copy all files from this directory to the corresponding directory 
on your machine.

Here is a sample set of  ftp commands used in the process of copying 
the benchmark data file-by-file.

   cd pub/benchmark/LayoutSynth92
   mget LayoutSynth92.*
   prompt         	# Should turn prompting off.
   ! mkdir bench     # make 'bench' dir on local machine.
   lcd bench      	# move to 'bench' on local machine.
   cd bench    	# move to 'bench' on remote machine.
   mget *         	# get files from remote to local 'bench'.
   !mkdir block      # make 'bench/block' on local.
   lcd block      	#  etc.
   cd block
   mget *
   ! mkdir ../compact
   lcd ../compact
   cd ../compact
   mget *
   ! mkdir c123_2.subcells
   lcd c123_2.subcells
   cd c123_2.subcells
   mget *
   ! mkdir ../mul.subcells
   lcd ../mul.subcells
   cd ../mul.subcells
   ! mkdir ../../flex
   lcd ../../flex
   cd ../../flex
   mget *

... etc. for the remaining directories.

We strongly recommend that you log in via ftp around May 1 to check for 
changes and corrections. Any such changes will be described in the file 
'ANNOUNCEMENTS'.

If you wish so, the benchmarks will be sent to you by electronic mail. 
There are about 13 megabytes of data. Since some mailers restrict the 
message size, please be prepared to receive the benchmarks in about 130 
installments. Please let me know if you have the 'compress' and 
'uudecode' utilities - encoding the benchmark data with those two 
programs reduces the size of the transferred data to about 3.7 Mb.

Benchmark presentation

You may choose to present your results either as a highlight of yours 
scheduled workshop presentation or during a special session that will 
introduce the benchmark posters. In either case, please submit the 
benchmark results to me at the address given at the end of this letter. 
All results will be compiled as anonymous contributions unless you 
request to be identified.

During your benchmark presentation, please be prepared to describe 
briefly the distinguishing features of your layout system. An overhead 
projector will be provided. Your presentation should not take more than 
5 minutes and 2-4 foils.

If you use the layout benchmarks in your research but do not plan to 
attend the workshop, please do not hesitate to send in your results 
anyway. If you include two to three short paragraphs with a short 
description of your layout system, they will be conveyed to the workshop 
participants together with your results.

In case of problems ...

While most of the benchmarks were used for the past two years without 
significant problems reported, it is possible that there may be some 
ambiguity or errors in the recent additions. Therefore, please send your 
electronic mail address and phone number to kk@mcnc.org when you pick up 
the benchmarks. In this way, if corrections or explanations are needed, 
they can be broadcast without delay. If you discover an error in a 
benchmark (such as two gates shorted together), we ask that you try to 
run it as it stands, if possible, and then again with your fix. Of 
course, please inform me about the problem as soon as possible.
Of course, please also let me know about any comments or suggestions 
regarding the benchmarks or documentation. I can be reached at the 
following address:

==================== Timberwolf Hunt =============================

As a part of the 1992 International Workshop on Layout Synthesis, we 
intend to stage a real-time contest for standard cell placement software. 
As you are undoubtedly aware, there exists a polarization of opinions in 
the CAD community whether statistical methods such as simulated annealing 
or algorithmic methods are better to use for placement if the smallest-
area solution is desired. At this year's Layout Synthesis Workshop we hope 
to have a showdown of the best placement programs. The conditions are as 
follows:

*  MCNC will provide remote access to a number of identically configured 
   workstations. We intend to provide a number of SPARCstations 2, with 
   32 MB of RAM, running under SunOS 4.1.1. We expect these workstations 
   to be accessible on the afternoon of Monday, May 11.

*  Exactly at noon on Monday, May 18, a previously unpublished netlist 
   will be provided to the contest participants. It will contain 
   approximately 13,000 standard cells. The objective will be to produce 
   a smallest-area core using a given number of rows, with I/O from the 
   core placed in desired locations on the core perimeter (it should be 
   possible to river-route to the pads, but pads and river-routing are 
   not included in the total area). The first run counts: the idea is to 
   see how well your program would perform for somebody who treats is as 
   a tool (as opposed to a research object) and wants the job done without
   fine-tuning of any parameters.

*  48 hours later, exactly at noon on Wednesday, May 20, the smallest-
   area layouts will be gathered from all participants and plotted on a 
   color Versatec. The presentation of the results will take place in 
   the evening session at 7:30 PM.

*  To isolate the placement quality from the routing quality, the global 
   router and compacting channel router will be provided respectively by 
   Yale University and MCNC. The output data from the placement program 
   should be in the VPNR format. Essentially, this format lists cells in 
   each row, from left to the right. A sample input for the global 
   router will be provided (in a couple of days) in the directory 
   pub/benchmark/LayoutSynth92/SampleGR. We believe that both routers 
   are state-of-the-art; however, if you prefer to use your own, you can 
   run them in addition to ours. The final output should be in the CIF 
   format. We expect that the time used for routing this benchmark will 
   be about 6 CPU hours. To be safe, you should probably time your 
   placement to finish by Tuesday, 6 PM.

To participate in the Timberwolf Hunt, please let me know your intent 
before May 1 at the address below. The number of entrants is limited to 
the number of available workstations. If you have any suggestions as to 
the contest itself or its format, please let me know.

The new benchmark data will be available in three formats: VPNR, 
Timberwolf and YAL. The contest participants should ensure that they can 
read one of these formats. YAL has been used to describe benchmark 
circuits since 1987, and VPNR since 1989. Please try out your software 
on the benchmarks distributed in the previous years: these benchmarks 
included two sample parsers for either of these languages, so you should 
have no problems doing translation to your data format of choice.

		Public access FTP system benchmark statistics
		--------------------------------------------------------
		(contributed by Douglas Maltais, MCNC, maltais@mcnc.org)

During January to March of this year, over 130 users used the public 
access FTP site at MCNC to obtain benchmark files.  The breakdown of the 
number of files retrieved from each set is as follows:

   	247 	 	CircuitSim90
          9	 	Compaction86
         48 		HLSynth89
    	 99 	 	HLSynth91
    	 68  		ISCAS85
   	176   		ISCAS89
   	127   		LayoutSynth90
    	 17  	 	LGSynth89
   	266   		LGSynth91
    	 71  	 	Modgen89
    	 38  	 	PDWorkshop91
    	 15 	 	PRWorkshop88

During the same time period, only six benchmark tapes were shipped. The
success of the e-mail delivery system is a likely reason for this low 
number. Many of the researchers who do not have FTP access would otherwise 
have been forced to order tapes, but can instead receive benchmarks 
through e-mail.

==========================================================================
		Moscow Gets Benchmarks
		--------------------------------------------------------
		(contributed by Douglas Maltais, MCNC, maltais@mcnc.org)

A site in the former Soviet Union received an official distribution of
benchmarks this February.  Dr. Kornilov of NIISAPRAN, the National Academy
of Russia, contacted Dr. Hoerbst of Siemens, Munich about the availability
of the ISCAS '85 benchmarks. Dr. Hoerbst referred the request to MCNC in
order to get the official source for the files.  After confirming that no
e-mail or FTP access was available, a tape was shipped out.

It is standard procedure to "fill up" shipped tapes to the maximum 
capacity. Because of the large capacity of the data cartridge used for Dr. 
Kornilov's request, nearly all of the available benchmark sets were 
delivered, in addition to the ISCAS '85 set.  Hopefully, these files will 
eventually reach other researchers in Russia and Eastern Europe who have 
not previously had access to them.

We at MCNC would like to thank Dr. Hoerbst and Michael Pilsl of Siemens 
for their assistance in contacting Dr. Kornilov.

Since FTP access to Japan is often slow or non-existant, Dr. Hidetoshi 
Onodera of Kyoto University has volunteered to assist in the distribution 
of the Layout Synthesis 1992 benchmark files.  Researchers in Japan can 
contact Dr. Onodera at the address below to arrange distribution if access 
to the MCNC site is difficult.
